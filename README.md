# Hough-Transform-CV
Hough transform concept applied on image for cv assignment
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a brief description of the concepts used in the project:

## Concept Overview

### Tkinter
**Tkinter** is a standard Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of tools and widgets to build interactive applications, allowing users to create windows, buttons, labels, and dialogs. In this project, Tkinter is used to build the main interface for loading images, displaying them, and interacting with various image processing features.

### OpenCV
**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)** is a powerful library for image and video processing. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for manipulating images, detecting features, and applying advanced transformations. In this project, OpenCV is employed to perform tasks such as image loading, processing (e.g., blurring, edge detection), and displaying the results. It serves as the backbone for the image processing functionality.

### Integration
The project integrates Tkinter and OpenCV to create an interactive image processing application. Users can load images through a Tkinter-based GUI, apply various OpenCV processing techniques, and view the results within the same application. This combination leverages the strengths of both libraries: Tkinter for user interaction and OpenCV for advanced image manipulation.
